# Fitness Routine Timer

An interval time 'Progressive Web App'.

This started out as a simple vanilla javascipt PWA, but grew to be a webpack app so it could support more than just chrome browsers (& Android devices).

As much of a learning by doing exercise as a fitness timer.

## What does it do.

Provides a list of routines. 
The user chooses a routine, and can see detail of what the routine involves.
When the user starts the routine, the app counts down each interval. 
Supports SubRoutines, i.e. common warmup cooldown.
Supports repeating a SubRountine - i.e. sets
Allows you to see what is coming up as well as what you should be doing.
With 3 seconds to go alerts you that this interval is coming to an end.

## Next steps

* Use GitHub actions to build this.
* Introduce sets of routines
* Figure out why sound doesn't work on Safari, and alternative approach for it.
